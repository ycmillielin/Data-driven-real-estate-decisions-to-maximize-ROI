  ● Perform social, economic, housing, and demographic spatial multivariate time series analysis to explain
  and forecast the trends in the real estate markets.     
  ● Identify the key drivers of the rent growth.     
  ● Conduct “Hot Spot” analysis and identify the “hottest spots” that are predicted to generate the highest
  profits and monetize your forecasts.
